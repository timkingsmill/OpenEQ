// CMake builds don't use an AppConfig.h, so it's safe to include juce module headers
// directly. If you need to remain compatible with Projucer-generated builds, and
// have called `juce_generate_juce_header(<thisTarget>)` in your CMakeLists.txt,
// you could `#include <JuceHeader.h>` here instead, to make all your module headers visible.
